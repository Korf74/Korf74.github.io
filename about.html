			 <h3 class="clr1">About me</h3>
			 <div class="company_details">
				 <p>My name is <strong>Rémi Coudert [ʁemi kudɛʁ]</strong>, I'm 21 and I'm French. I come from Thonon-les-Bains which is east of France, near Switzerland. I graduated from High School there with "Mention très bien" and 17.5/20 GPA and am now working towards my Master degree in Lausanne, Switzerland in Computer Science at EPFL.</p>

				<p>I'm eager to learn in my everyday life and this applies to my work as well. I curious of almost everything including Ccience but also Social Sciences, Society Studies, Philosophy, Astronomy, History, Economics, Politics, Physics, Metaphysics... I try not to limit myself to Computer Science even though I'm aiming at eventually doing a PhD in this field. I'm hard-working and can be very enthusiastic when a project interests me.</p>

				<p>My goal would be to eventually get into academic research or in R&D in industries. I'd love to solve challenging problems that'd prove being meaningful, and I'd love to be part of modern science at my modest level.</p>

				<p>During my High School years, I was part of Thonon Black Panthers American Football Team (a big French team), as a U19. Through this sport, I developed a sense of discipline, hard work, and self-transcendence, that proved very useful in my everyday life. My hard work paid off since I took park of 2014 U19 World Championship in Kuwait City (Kuwait) and at the same time I were accepted at EPFL (14th University in the World according to QS rankings). I managed to get my Bachelor since then with a good GPA and I'm looking forward to learn more advanced computer science during my Master.</p> 

				<p>I'm also the Co-founder and Co-president of PolyGameDev, EPFL's Game Development club.</p
