My name is **Rémi Coudert [ʁemi kudɛʁ]**, I'm a Software Engineer/Computer Scientist based in French Chablais, by the leman lake.

I graduated from EPFL (Ecole Polytechnique Federale de Lausanne) with a MSc in Computer Science and an engineering diploma in 2020 and am currently employed as a Backend Software Engineer at [Komugi](https://www.komugi.io/fr/) in Thonon-les-Bains, France. Komugi is a software solution helping manufacturing industries pilot their plants with task scheduling, people and machine management, KPI feedback, scenario capabilities etc...

Before that I worked at ELCA Security as a Security engineer, at Lausanne University's Information Security and Privacy lab as a research engineer.

I defended my Master thesis in the field of privacy at [PRIVATICS lab](https://team.inria.fr/privatics/) in Grenoble under the supervision of [Claude Castelluccia](https://team.inria.fr/privatics/claude-castelluccia/).

I am particularly interested in privacy, on both its technical side and its ethical/social one and security in general. I also have a keen interest in compilers and programming languages.

On a more personal note, I am a former member of [Polyquity](http://polyquity.agepoly.ch/), EPFL's association for gender equality for which I have been its Vice-President from January to September 2019.

During my High School years, I was part of Thonon Black Panthers American Football Team, as a U19 and later a starter Running Back in Team France U19 and took part of 2014 U19 World Championship in Kuwait City (Kuwait).

I have been coaching Black Panthers's U17 team between Sept. 2021 and July 2024. We reached the swiss national championship semi-finals in 2023.
