My name is **Rémi Coudert [ʁemi kudɛʁ]**, I'm a Cyber Security Engineer working in Lausanne, Switzerland.

I graduated from EPFL (Ecole Polytechnique Federale de Lausanne) with a MSc in Computer Science and an engineering diploma in 2020 and am currently employed as a Cyber Security Engineer at ELCA informatique in Lausanne.

Before that I worked on my Master thesis in the field of privacy at [PRIVATICS lab](https://team.inria.fr/privatics/) in Grenoble under the supervision of [Claude Castelluccia](https://team.inria.fr/privatics/claude-castelluccia/).

I am particularly interested in privacy, on both its technical side and its ethical/social one and security in general. I also have a keen interest in compilers and programming languages. I seldom participate in CTFs.

On a more personal note, I am a former member of [Polyquity](http://polyquity.agepoly.ch/), EPFL's association for gender equality for which I have been its Vice-President from January to September 2019.

During my High School years, I was part of Thonon Black Panthers American Football Team, as a U19. Through this sport, I developed a sense of discipline, hard work, and self-transcendence, that proved very useful in my everyday life. My hard work paid off since I took part of 2014 U19 World Championship in Kuwait City (Kuwait) and at the same time I were accepted at EPFL (14th University in the World according to QS rankings).
