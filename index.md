Welcome to my personal website, it is not completely done but you can find all professional informations about me within it.

I'm a Master student in computer science at Lausanne Institute of Technology/Ecole Polytechnique Federale de Lausanne (EPFL) and am currently working for Logitech as an intern working on a data science project.

Feel free to contact me at [remi.coudert@epfl.ch](mailto:remi.coudert@epfl.ch).
